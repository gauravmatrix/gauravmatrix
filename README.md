## 👋 About Me

I am a **full-stack engineer in progress**, driven by curiosity and a strong desire to understand how real-world systems work — from backend architecture and database design to deployment, performance, and security.

I believe software engineering is not just about writing code, but about **solving meaningful problems, designing scalable systems, and making thoughtful technical decisions**.  
My learning approach focuses on **deep understanding, clean architecture, and real-world project building**, rather than copy-paste implementations.

**Principle I follow:**  
> *Think in systems. Build with purpose. Learn with depth.*
